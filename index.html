        <h2>üìú Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Sam, and I am a skilled software developer with a passion for machine learning and data visualization applications, as well as software quality assurance frameworks and tools like Kubernetes. In my professional career, I have worked on a variety of projects, from developing web applications to building custom machine learning models.
        </p>

        <p>
          My expertise includes not only writing code for these applications, but also understanding the underlying data structures and algorithms that make them work. I have developed machine learning models using libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch and have also used programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java to create custom data visualization frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are interested in learning more about my background and experience, feel free to take a look at my portfolio website, where I showcase some of my recent projects. You can also reach out to me through the contact information provided on my site.

        <h1>Resuyay</h1>
        <p>
A GPT-2 Based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for writing cover letters, coupled with SpaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER) for custom skill extraction and contextualization of cover letters. First use the TesseRecognition service above to turn a resume into text, then press the "Read Skills" button to extract skills from that text. Skills will be displayed below this button. Edit to your liking, then when you are finished paste a copy of the job description you want into the box adjacent to it, which says "Enter the Job Description Here..." and press the "Generate Cover Letter" button to generate a cover letter tailored to these parameters.
